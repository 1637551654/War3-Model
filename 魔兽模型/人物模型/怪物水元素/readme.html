<br />
Since Im releasing nagas I thought this was fitting. No portrait, it has a camera though. <br />
Animations are from the Firelord, textures from various blizz models. Might redo this model later, like a new texture and new animations, but dont expect it soon.<br />
Give credits to me when using this model.<br />
