Tidal Lord
By Tarrasque

Description:
A model I did for the Hero Contest 2 at wc3c.net

Since Im releasing nagas I thought this was fitting. No portrait, it has a camera though. 
Animations are from the Firelord, textures from various blizz models. Might redo this model later, like a new texture and new animations, but dont expect it soon.
Give credits to me when using this model.
